<h2>Task 1: Dialogue Summarization with FLAN-T5</h2>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong> This task involved summarizing dialogues from a dataset named "Dialogue sum" using the FLAN-T5 model. Our approach included a variety of techniques aimed at improving the model's ability to generate concise summaries from conversations.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Environment Setup:</strong> We began by setting up our environment, which included installing necessary Python libraries such as PyTorch, Torch data, and Hugging Face Transformers.</li>
  <li><strong>Model and Tokenizer:</strong> The FLAN-T5 model, along with its tokenizer, was loaded from the Hugging Face Transformers library to facilitate our summarization tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Initial Attempts:</strong> Our initial attempts to summarize dialogues did not yield satisfactory results, prompting us to explore various prompting techniques.</li>
  <li><strong>Prompt Engineering:</strong> We experimented with different prompts, including zero-shot inference and in-context learning, to refine the summarization outputs.</li>
  <li><strong>Inference Techniques:</strong> Techniques such as one-shot and few-shot inference were explored, providing the model with examples to improve its performance.</li>
  <li><strong>Parameter Tuning:</strong> The impact of configuration parameters, like sampling temperature, on model responses was investigated. Adjusting these parameters can lead to more varied and creative responses.</li>
  <li><strong>Objective:</strong> The overarching goal was to familiarize users with the nuances of prompt engineering and model fine-tuning for enhanced summarization results.</li>
</ul>

<p>By exploring different techniques and fine-tuning the model, we aimed to achieve more accurate and concise summaries of dialogues, enhancing the model's utility for real-world applications.</p>
